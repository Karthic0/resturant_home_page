# Food Ordering Landing Page

## Overview

This project is a simple, responsive food-ordering landing page built using **HTML5** and **CSS3**. It was one of my first complete web development projects and represents my early understanding of layout design, styling, animations, and user interaction on the web.

The goal of this project was not to rely on frameworks or libraries, but to understand how core web technologies work at a fundamental level.

## Key Features

* Clean navigation bar with hover effects
* CSS-based animations for text and images
* Flexbox-based layout for alignment and spacing
* Simple call-to-action button with transitions
* Responsive structure using flexible units and media queries

## Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3 (Flexbox, animations, transitions)

## What This Project Demonstrates

* Understanding of semantic HTML structure
* Practical use of CSS Flexbox for layout design
* Use of pseudo-elements and hover states for UI effects
* Basic animation concepts using `@keyframes`
* Attention to visual hierarchy and user experience

## Project Context

This project was created as a learning exercise during the early stage of my computer science journey. It reflects my foundational skills at the time and my curiosity about front-end development.

While the code is not framework-based or production-optimized, it shows:

* Willingness to experiment and learn by building
* Ability to translate a visual idea into code
* Growth mindset and continuous improvement

## Limitations

* No JavaScript functionality
* No backend or dynamic data handling
* Limited responsiveness on very small screens

These limitations are intentional, as the focus was on mastering HTML and CSS basics.

## Future Improvements

* Improve mobile responsiveness
* Add accessibility enhancements
* Introduce JavaScript for interactivity
* Refactor CSS for better scalability
